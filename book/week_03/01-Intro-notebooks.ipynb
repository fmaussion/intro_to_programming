    "Today we are going to learn about [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)! The advantage of notebooks is that they can include explanatory text, code, and plots in the same document. **This makes notebooks an ideal playground for explaining and learning new things without having to jump between several documents.** You will use notebooks a LOT during your studies, and this is why I decided to teach you how they work very early in your programming journey.\n",
