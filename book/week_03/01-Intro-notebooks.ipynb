    "Today we are going to learn about [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)! The advantage of notebooks is that they can include explanatory text, code, and plots in the same document. **This makes notebooks an ideal playground for explaining and learning new things without having to jump between several documents.** You will use notebooks a LOT during your studies, and this is why I decided to teach you how they work very early in your programming journey.\n",

    "This document itself is a notebook. It is a simple text file with a `.ipynb` file path ending. Notebooks are best opened in \"JupyterLab\", the development environment that you learned about last week.\n",

    "**Note: learning about notebooks is less urgent than learning how to write correct code. If you are feeling overwhelmed by coding, you should focus on the coding exercises for now and learn about notebooks a bit later. They will only become mandatory in about 2 to 3 weeks.**\n",
