    "The current learning and teaching practices are undergoing a major transformation, rapidly propelled by [generative artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence). Tools like ChatGPT, which are easily accessible and free (for now), have proven to be more efficient in solving simple programming tasks compared to conventional methods such as a web search or relying on our own intellect. Ignoring this transformation would be unwise. In this brief lesson, I will highlight the available tools and advise on cautionary measures to be taken.\n",

    " > Generative AI can produce code by using a neural network to learn from a large dataset of source code. The network is trained to understand the syntax, structure, and meaning of the code. Once the model has been trained, it can generate new code by taking a prompt or seed code as input and generating a sequence of tokens to complete the code. However, the generated code may not always be optimal or meet specific requirements, so it's important to evaluate and modify it before using it in a real-world application.\n",

    "> 5. Difficulty with real-world application: AI-generated solutions may not always be applicable in real-world scenarios, leading to difficulties when applying programming concepts to practical problems.\n",
    "> 6. Dependence on technology: Students may become too reliant on generative AI tools and lose the ability to solve programming problems manually, leading to difficulties in situations where technology is not available or applicable.\n",

It can also offer a more engaging and interactive way for students to learn programming, which may increase motivation and interest in the subject.\n",

Simply accepting ChatGPT's output without proper scrutiny could lead to erroneous conclusions. Always remember: ChatGPT is often \"hallucinating\". \n",

This can occur when a generative model is trained on incomplete or biased data, or when the model's architecture or training process is flawed in some way.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> For example, a generative model trained on images of dogs may generate images of creatures that resemble dogs, but have additional features or characteristics that do not exist in real dogs. This could be due to the model's inability to accurately capture the true distribution of dog images in the training data, or due to limitations in the model's architecture that prevent it from accurately modeling the complex relationships between the input and output data.\n",

    "> Similarly, a generative model trained on text may generate text that is grammatically correct and semantically coherent, but does not accurately reflect the nuances or complexities of the real world. This could be due to biases or limitations in the training data, or due to limitations in the model's ability to accurately capture the complex relationships between the input and output data.\n",
