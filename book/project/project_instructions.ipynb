I expect a plot similar to [this example](https://github.com/fmaussion/intro_to_programming/blob/master/book/project/precip_dailycycle.png). To compute the daily cycle, I recommend to combine two very useful tools. First, start by noticing that `ds.index.hour` exists and can be used to categorize data. Then, note that `df.groupby` exists and can be used exactly for that ([documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/groupby.html#aggregation))."

    "The last part of this semester project is up to you! You are free to explore whatever interests you. **I however add three requirements**:\n",
    "1. This section should have at least 5 original plots in it. They are the output of your analysis.\n",
    "2. This section should also use additional data that you downloaded yourself. The easiest way would probably be to download another station(s) from the ZAMG database, or data from the same station but for another time period (e.g. for trend or change analysis). You can, however, decide to do something completely different if you prefer (as long as you download and read one more file).\n",
    "3. this section should contain at least one regression or correlation analysis between two parameters. Examples: \n",
    "    - between two different variables at the same station (like we did with the dewpoint above)\n",
    "    - between different stations (for example, average temperature as a function of station elevation)\n",
    "    - between average temperature and time (trends analysis)\n",
    "    - etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it! Here are a few ideas:\n",
    "- detection of trends and changes at the station Innsbruck for 1993-2021\n",
    "- comparison of 5-yr climatologies at various stations in Tirol, taking elevation or location into account\n",
    "- compute the theoretical day length from the station's longitude and latitude (you can find solutions for this online, just let me know the source if you used a solution online), and use these computations to compare the measured sunshine duration to the maximum day length. This can be used to classify \"sunshine days\" for example.\n",
    "- use the python \"windrose\" library to plot a windrose at different locations and time of day.\n",
    "- etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have your own idea but are unsure about whether this is too much or not enough, come to see me in class! In general, the three requirements above should be enough.\n",
