# Presentation slides

I won't do many "formal" presentations during the lectures. When I'll do, I'll provide links to the presentation's slides here.

The slides are prepared with [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com). Use `space` and `shift+space` to navigate back and forth between slides, and use `esc` to get an overview of all slides.
