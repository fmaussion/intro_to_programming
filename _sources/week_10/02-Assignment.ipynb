    "Your task is to make a map as close as possible to [this one](https://github.com/fmaussion/intro_to_programming/blob/master/book/week_10/station_map.png). It displays the location and elevation of all ZAMG weather stations in Austria. Some pointers to get you on track:\n",
    "- the location and elevation of all stations is read from the `ZEHNMIN Stations-Metadaten.csv` file that you can download [here](https://github.com/fmaussion/intro_to_programming/raw/master/book/project/ZEHNMIN%20Stations-Metadaten.csv). `pandas` can read it without any problems.\n",
    "- the map is done with matplotlib and cartopy. I build my map based on elements from the following tutorials from the [official documentation](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/gallery/index.html):\n",
    "    - [map tile aquisition](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/gallery/scalar_data/eyja_volcano.html#sphx-glr-gallery-scalar-data-eyja-volcano-py) for the map background\n",
    "    - [features](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/gallery/lines_and_polygons/features.html#sphx-glr-gallery-lines-and-polygons-features-py) for the country borders\n",
    "    - [grid lines and tick labels](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/gallery/gridlines_and_labels/gridliner.html#sphx-glr-gallery-gridlines-and-labels-gridliner-py) for the lat lon grid \n",

    "It is fine for me if you don't manage to do the exact same map as mine. You can be creative as well! Any step towards completion is a good step. To help you further, here are all the imports I used for this task:"
