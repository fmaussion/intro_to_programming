# External resources 

Resources used (and linked) in these lecture notes:


**Fundamentals:**
- [Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)](https://www.py4e.com). We will follow this textbook for roughly the first half of the lecture.

**Linux and bash scripting:**
- [Ryan's Tutorials](https://ryanstutorials.net/) for the linux command line and bash scripting are entertaining and well designed.

**Python tutorials:**
- the [official tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html), always a good place to start if you are coming from another language (not so good for beginners in programming though).
- the [scipy lecture notes](http://scipy-lectures.org), a good overview of the scientific python stack for scientists with previous programming experience.

**Python reference:**
- the [python documentation](https://docs.python.org) is your best reference for any question related to the language and the standard library.
