# Introduction

As a teacher, my main goal is that you feel confident enough using python for daily tasks.

As a student, your daily tasks are mostly... homework!

**I won't do your homework for you here**, but I'm happy to share recipes on common *programming* problems that you might encounter in your studies. This cookbook will be updated with time if you send me your problems.
